# SiteFab data structures

SiteFab have three main data structures:

1. Site: Object representation of the entire Site
2. [Post](/documentation/post.md): Site basic unit. Mostly created from the .md files and potentially by plugin. Each .md has its own post Object
3. [Collection](/documentation/collection.md): A collection of posts that share the same topic, template or microformat type.
