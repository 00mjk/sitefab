Here are the 5 ways I bulletproof my credit cards against identity theft, and you can use them yourself very easily. As a bonus, at the end of the post I have added an experimental step to defend against the recent chip downgrading attack.

## Donâ€™t be an easy mark: never share a photo of your credit card on a social network

This tip might seem obvious but people still do share a photo of their credit card on social networks. The screenshot above, taken from Twitter, shows an example of what not to do. I did obfuscate the key information as the person who shared it had not. As a matter of fact, never share any photo of a document on a social network :)

## Prevent remote reading by using a RFID blocking sleeve or wallet

If you have a recent card, the chances are it is contactless, which might leave you open to [remote attacks](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-29862080) and privacy leaks. 
For example, as visible in the screenshot above, using a dedicated [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.devnied.emvnfccard), I was easily able to use a remote NFC reader to extract my credit card number, 
its expiration date and the log of the last 10 transactions. Testing with various cards, it seems that the last transactions
are not always reported, in particular in european cards. Researchers have shown that it is possible to read this information
from the (short) distance of 45 cm, so protecting against remote reading is important.
